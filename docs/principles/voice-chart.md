## What's a Voice Chart

> "The voice chart holds a set of **decision-making rules and creative guidance to make the UX content align to the needs of the organization and of the person using the experience**. " - **Torrey Podmajersky**, Strategic Writing for UX

A UX Writing Voice Chart is a tool designed by Torrey Podmajersky and described in her book *Strategic Writing for UX*. It is an effective resource that serves as the primary guide for everyone writing microcopy in our platform. It reminds us how the words we see on screen are actually part of a larger structure, connected to VTEX's goals and personality. Every word should be chosen carefully and strategically. The Voice Chart provides us the means to write precise and effective microcopy, alligned with what we wish to transmit to our users. 

## When should I use the Voice Chart?

This chart is your ally when writing microcopy. It can help you brainstorm, draft, edit and choose the right words. Have it with you whenever you are:
- Drafting UX copy, and seeking to allign it to our brand's voice.   
- No sure which option is the best, from what you brainstormed.    
- Editing your UX copy, adjusting grammar, punctuation and capitalization.  
- Polishing your copy to make it alligned to VTEX and the user's goals.

## Main Pillars

### üß≠ Product Principles

*"These principles define what the experience is trying to be to the people who use it. Then, the voice can do its job of conveying those product principles with every word." - **Torrey Podmajersky***

### üéØ Concepts

*"The concepts are the ideas or topics that the organization wants to emphasize at any open opportunity, even when they aren‚Äôt a part of the task at hand. They are the ideas that reflect the role that the organization wants the experience to have in the person‚Äôs life." - **Torrey Podmajersky***

### üìñ Vocabulary

"*Where specific words can support or undermine a voice principle, use the Vocabulary row to specify them. If there aren‚Äôt specific words that help land the principle, you can omit this row. It doesn‚Äôt replace a robust word list or terminology list." - **Torrey Podmajersky***

### üí¨ Verbosity

"*For strict usability, the words inside an experience should get out of people‚Äôs way. The UX text isn‚Äôt there to be savored or read for pleasure. But using few words where many are expected can block a person from moving forward as thoroughly as using too many words where few are expected. Screen size and reading format makes a difference, too" - **Torrey Podmajersky*** 

### üìù Grammar

*"Natural language gives us a rich variety of ways to construct and convey our ideas, but all of those ways don‚Äôt work in all experiences." -* ***Torrey Podmajersky*** 

### üÖ∞Ô∏è Punctuation and Capitalization

"*This is where most style guides do their heavy lifting: when to use commas, how to use en dashes, and more." - **Torrey Podmajersky***
