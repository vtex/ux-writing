## 


We need to allign all our communication strategies, so our brand's voice is recognizable regardless of the medium our user is interacting with. 
Once a person becomes our client, and starts using our solutions, they should still recognize our voice. However, we understand that there's differences when writing a blog post, and writing an error message. 
Keep in mind our Brand Principles, 



## Brand Principles

### 🎯 Trust to be trusted

To trust is to believe with eyes closed and to delegate responsibilities. To be trustworthy you need honesty, transparency and consistency in quality and performance. This bond is built upon exchange: trust to be trusted.

### 🎯 Build for community

It’s all about being ready to grow and reach new levels together. Have a solid foundation, modular thinking and flexible essence, and you’re building for the community. We are global but we’re audacious enough to aim for the stars.

### 🎯 Be bold

Boldness is about challenging the status quo and not being afraid to make mistakes or take risks. Test new alternatives, walk into the unknown and explore possibilities no one thought about. To be bold is to apologize, not ask for permission.



## Tone and Voice

There are other characteristics that also define our tone and voice. For UX Writing, we chose to keep only the ones below, for we understand that they capture the reliability our system's voice should have. 


### 📣 Serious

We speak firmly, respectfully and honestly—always with a tone that’s more serious than playful.

**Serious, not playful:** To build trust, we must avoid jokes, puns, and everything that may sound ambiguous. Being straightforward and honest is the key.

### 📣 Authority

We are the e-commerce bastions. When speaking to others, we talk with mastery, proficiency and expertise.

**Authority, not arbitrary:** We're commerce and technology specialists. Our content embodies that expertise to be useful for our users, never pretentious or obnoxious. Sounding trustful is the key.

## Brand's Writing Principles

### 📝 Clarity

No matter the media, the objective, or the audience. Make sure your content is free from any possible ambiguities. Being straightforward on complex (or delicate) themes will help users better understand the message.

### 📝 Suitability

Are you writing for engineers or e-commerce analysts? Are you channeling your message through an online banner or a downloadable white paper? Forget about right or wrong. Consider the target audience, the channel, and focus on what's appropriate.

### 📝 Precision

Stick to the main message you want to communicate and cut everything else. Mixing up many different topics will only confuse the audience and lower the performance of your content.
