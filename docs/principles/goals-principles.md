### 📝 Suitability

Are you writing for engineers or e-commerce analysts? Are you channeling your message through an online banner or a downloadable white paper? Forget about right or wrong. Consider the target audience, the channel, and focus on what's appropriate.

### 📝 Precision

Stick to the main message you want to communicate and cut everything else. Mixing up many different topics will only confuse the audience and lower the performance of your content.
