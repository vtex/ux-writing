## Making our content accessible 

At VTEX, we need to have a continuous concern with accessible and usable content. This can impact not only making everything available as a text, but also organizing content and guiding screen readers through a page. Another thing to consider is that accessibility includes users of all mental and physical capacities, whether situational (broken glasses!) or more permanent.

Right now, our work towards this objective is very small. This document will be updated with new information and guidelines, helping everyone at VTEX to write and provide accessible content.
