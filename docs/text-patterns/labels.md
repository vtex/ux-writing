## Tone and Voice

Labels should help users, and not become the text that they skip while skimming through a page. Be specific. We are ecommerce experts, and we master our customer's diverse contexts. Make sure to always use ecommerce jargons.

- Meet the user's mental model, use ecommerce vocabulary.  
- If you think a label should have more clarification about its meaning, you could use a **tooltip**.
