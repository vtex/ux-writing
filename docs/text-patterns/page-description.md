## Tone and Voice

We trust to be trusted. We're serious, and we never alarm users, we soothe their anxieties. We add descriptions to deliver transparency, so users are aware of liabilities, and sensitive data.  We want to add precision with descriptions, not trigger doubts. W're reliable. After reading our descriptions, users should be confident about what actions they want to take.       


## 👍 Dos

- Make descriptions as scannable as possible. Users usually skim through, or skip descriptions entirely.
- Descriptions should be clear, never ambiguous.. 
- They should be present anywhere there's a sensitive action taking place. Make sure the user understands the implications of changing a setting, for example.
- Keep it brief. Prefer a maximum of 2 sentences, but break down longer sentences if it adds clarity.
