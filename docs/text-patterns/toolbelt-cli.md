title: Toolbelt Comand Line Interface
---

VTEX CLI, Toolbelt, provides an informative experience to our users, focused on showing what can be done with the tool and the impacts actions have on their applications. We support users from all levels of expertise, creating interaction layers that allow simple update tasks as much as complex debug challenges. 

## Basic guidelines to ensure we fulfill our mission

- **After running a command, the important information is always at the end of the content we show**. We don't want to do the user scroll up on the terminal.
- We communicate what happened and what to do next as a message pattern (for errors, success, and info).
- Our commands description explain why is it a good idea to use them: how can it improve the experience that's been created to the final users?
- Toolbelt is proactive: we precipitated what a user may need and suggest actions using the  `Y/n` from the command prompt. Our users usually don't have to *run the commands*, just confirm.
