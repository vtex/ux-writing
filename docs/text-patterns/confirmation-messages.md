## Tone and Voice

Confirmation messages are key when reinforcing our trust-worthy nature. Keep in mind the balance between transparency and excess of information, that frictions our user's actions. 


## 👍 Dos

- Transmit positivity, but don't forget our authority/seriousness.    
- Mind the priority of the message, as the specific visual solution can limit the available text size.    

💡Examples


## 👎 Don'ts
- Avoid using illegible terms in your copy, from the back-end.
