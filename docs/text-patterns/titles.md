## Content name

> "*When a screen is based on content, such as a blog post, social media post, or image, the screen might use a title based on that content: the content-name title. These content name titles can be specified by the person who created the content, like the publisher of a blog, or it can be generated from the content itself, like the titles generated for single posts on social media."*

## **Ambiguous task**

> "*On screens with multiple potential actions that the person can take, like a dashboard view of a person’s account, it’s helpful to use a title that covers the entire set of ambiguous tasks."*

💡Example: Subscriptions **Management**, Account **Overview**

## **Single task**

> *Single-task titles act as instructions for the person to take an action. 
Prefer imperative verb phrases as a direction to reinforce the correct action.*

💡Example: Create a New Affiliation, Edit Payment Methods, Received SKUs, Map Categories and Brands
