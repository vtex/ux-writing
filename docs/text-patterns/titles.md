> Titles immediately indicate context and possible actions in a given section.

## 👍Do's  

- Always name sections with titles. They clarify the context, facilitate documentation, and allow users to point out where their troubles are, in support tickets.      
- Always use title case.  
- Titles may be used in the following contexts:  
Brand names  
Defining a content's name  
Grouping ambiguous tasks   
Indicating single tasks   

### Brand name

> Branded terms should be capitalized accordingly. 

VTEX should always be on All Caps.   
Be mindful how other VTEX branded terms are written. They should be consistent throughout our platform and communication strategies. 

💡Examples
SmartCheckout, inStore, VTEX Payment.

### Content name

> "*When a screen is based on content, such as a blog post, social media post, or image, the screen might use a title based on that content: the content-name title. These content name titles can be specified by the person who created the content, like the publisher of a blog, or it can be generated from the content itself, like the titles generated for single posts on social media."* - Torrey Podmajersky

### **Ambiguous task**

> Screens that allow multiple actions still require titles to contextualize the user.

Prefer broader terms like *Management*, *Dashboard* and *Overview*, followed by another term that specifies the module at hand.

💡Example: Subscriptions **Management**, Account **Overview**.

## **Single task**

> Sections that are straight to the-point, where there's a single action the user must take.

Prefer imperative verb phrases that serve as instructions, and reinforce the action at hand.

💡Example: Create a New Affiliation, Edit Payment Methods, Map Categories and Brands
