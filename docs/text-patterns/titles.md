## Content name

> "*When a screen is based on content, such as a blog post, social media post, or image, the screen might use a title based on that content: the content-name title. These content name titles can be specified by the person who created the content, like the publisher of a blog, or it can be generated from the content itself, like the titles generated for single posts on social media."* - Torrey Podmajersky

## **Ambiguous task**

> Screens that allow multiple actions still require titles to contextualize the user.

Prefer broader terms like Management, Dashboard and Overview, followed by another term that specifies the module at hand.

💡Example: Subscriptions **Management**, Account **Overview**

## **Single task**

> Sections that are straight to the-point, where there's a single action the user must take.

Prefer imperative verb phrases that serve as instructions, and reinforce the action at hand.


💡Example: Create a New Affiliation, Edit Payment Methods, Received SKUs, Map Categories and Brands
