> Triggers an action, or allows the user to advance a state. Where the user interacts with the screen. 

## Tone and Voice
Keep in mind the Authority we want to transmit with our voice. Buttons are where the action takes place. We're always sure where we want to direct our users, so they can accomplish their goals. There's no space for ambiguity in the actions we guide them to take, we convey decisiveness. 

## 👍 Dos
- Avoid using more than 3 words.  
- Buttons should be in all caps.  
- Prefer imperative verbs.  
- Prefer "Create" than "Add". 


💡Example: Create account, Edit dock. 

### Icons as buttons
- When using icons as buttons, be mindful of accessibility, always include descriptions in the alt tag.  
- Pay attention to the icon's use in other screens, be consistent of what action it represents.  

💡Example:  "←", "⚙️Settings"

## 👎 Don'ts
