## 👍 Dos

- **Completing the task is the main focus.** Our role is to assure that the user will finish the original task, giving enough information to do it.  
- Should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.  
- **The user needs to know exactly what happened.** Even if we work to assure full SLA, things can fail. There are even some scenarios that are beyond our direct control. Because of this, it’s extremely important that our users understand what are blocking them to finish their tasks.  
- **Errors must be actionable.** As users understand what is happening, we need to give them proper following actions.  
- We should always calm the user, not cause more stress.
