> Tools that customize configurations.  

## Tone and Voice

Adding controls to a screen is a useful way of making configurations more user friendly. The text that goes within them should also be intuitive. Transparency is key here, so the user knows exactly what they are altering. We should be Serious in this space, and show responsibility towards our users. We adapt to our user's mental model, so be clear when describing controls. Don't let them assume a control's consequence, be clear when describing it.  



## 👍 Dos

- Use titles to group related controls.      
- Choose words that are alligned with our ecommerce vocabulary.      
- You can write the current state of the control, to improve accessibility.            
- Add descriptions if the control is critical, or complex.
