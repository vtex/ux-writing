> Anticipate the precise data a field requires.    

## Tone and Voice

 We want to save our users' time when they input text, this is not the place for play, or ambiguity. As ecommerce authorities, we are precise, specific and meet the user's mental model.           



## 👍 Dos

- Exemplify the exact values the  field supports.        
- Be clear and straight to the point.      
- Use messages, descriptions or tooltips to give more context, if needed.         
- Avoid punctuation in Placeholder.        
- Input label and placeholder must use sentence case.      
- If an error occurs, give enough context to the user so they can solve it.      

### Search Bars

When adding text input for search bars, be mindful of the verbs you choose. Prefer imperative tense, not infinitive.   
You can follow this format:  

`Search for` + `exact search terms`    

💡Examples  
EN: **Search** for name, SKU **or** price  
PT: **Busque** por nome, SKU, **ou** preço
