## Tone and Voice

If pages or actions take a long time to load, it might bring impatience or frustration to our users. Adding transitional text help soften the user's reaction. This is a critical space to calm them, and not trigger more stress. Remember that we build trust and reliability through our product.   


## 👍 Dos

   
- Whenever possible, list the actions that are being taken, so the user can identify what's causing the wait.          
- Add animations, spinners or progress bars to amuse the user, and show we're working on it.          
- Prefer verbs in the gerund tense, to show continuous action.
