## Tone and Voice

If a page or an action take long enough to load, requiring a transitional text, it might bring impatience or frustration to our users. This is a critical space to calm them, and not trigger more stress. Remember we build trust, and reliability through our product.   




## 👍 Dos

   
- Whenever possible, list the actions that are being taken, so the user can identify what's causing the wait.        
- Add animations, spinners or progress bars to amuse the user, and show we're working on it.        
- Prefer verbs in the gerund tense, to show continuous action.
