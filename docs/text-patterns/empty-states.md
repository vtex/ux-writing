> Anticipate the type of data that falls into the empty state, but also to provoke an emotional response.

## Tone and Voice

Empty states mean opportunities for growth or improvements. This is where our commercial and ecommerce specialty can be explored. Keep the voice positive, focusing on scaling the client's business. Remember less is more, unless it's for cordiality.


## üëç Dos

### Positive states
- If the state is positive, show it! Make our users aware they've achieved a goal.
- We usually avoid exclamation marks, but this is where an exception can be made. If it's exciting news, provoke an emotional response with punctuation.
- Remember that empty states should be informative, not only emotional. Teach users what data should be present in the empty state. 

üí°Examples

### Negative states
- If the state is potentially negative, or if it was not the user's expectation, don't alarm them.   
- Explain why this state is happening and how they can solve it, with direct actions.
- Guide them to the solution by adding adjacent buttons, or linking related documentation.

## üëé Don'ts

- Avoid emojis as the single source of communication in empty states. They lack the seriousness we must convey. 
- Don't trigger anxiety with empty states. Be mindful of the balance between emphasis and stress.
