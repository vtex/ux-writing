## Who is this styleguide for?

UX writing is a collaborative craft in its essence.

In VTEX, we have different teams who collaborate to create the words on our experience. People from _Localization, Design, Product and Education_ teams usually take part in the UX Writing process.

We build for community. **If you are writing the text that appears on our VTEX platform's UI, this styleguide is for you**. It is the resource that everyone involved in UX Writing can count on, to create precise copy, aligned with our tone and voice, following best practices.

We might have different tools to accomplish our goals, but at the end of the day, we want the same thing: to facilitate an intuitive experience for VTEX customers. A shared responsibility means we tackle the challenge together, co-create the resources needed, and scale the access so we have agile processes.

This guide was developed seeking to educate our community about UX Writing in VTEX's context, with no commercial intention.

## What is UX Writing

> "An experience with broken words is a house with broken walls. Fix the words as you would repair the walls." - **Torrey Podmajersky, Strategic Writing for UX**, published by O'Reilly Media, Inc. in June 2019

UX Writing is the craft of designing the words that users see and interact with, in softwares. It is a vital component within the general user experience we want to promote to our clients. Text written in screens is often referred to as microcopy, for we have very limited space to convey actions and concepts.

Where can you find UX Writing, in our VTEX context:

- Our VTEX Commerce Admin
- VTEX IO apps and Toolbelt
- Our stand alone products, like VTEX Tracking
- Our platform status page
- APIs

## What UX Writing is not

UX Writing is not the same as creating content for websites, social media, or documentation. Likewise, this styleguide is not a general guide for copywriting. It is specifically for microcopy that is seen on our VTEX platform's UI, or APIs that developers interact with.
