## Who

UX writing is a collaborative craft in its essence. 

In VTEX, we have different teams who collaborate to create the words on our experience. People from  Localization, Design, Product and Education teams take part in the UX Writing process. 

We might have different tools to accomplish our goals, but at the end of the day, we want the same thing: to facilitate an intuitive experience for VTEX customers. A shared responsibility means we tackle the challenge together, co-create the resources needed, and scale the access so we have agile processes. 

In VTEX, we build for community. This UX Writing styleguide is the resource  everyone involved in writing for UX can count on, to create precise copy, alligned with our tone and voice, following best practices.
