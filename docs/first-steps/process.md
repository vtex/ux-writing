## UX Writing

UX Writing is the craft of designing the words that users see and interact with, in softwares. It is a vital component within the general user experience we want to promote to our clients. 


## Why

> "An experience with broken words is a house with broken walls. Fix the words as you would repair the walls." - Torrey Podmajersky, Strategic Writing for UX

By defining clear UX Writing guidelines, we wish to:

### Avoid
- **Inconsistent terminology:** a unified information architecture is vital when designing text. Terms must have contextualized, unique meanings, that are consistent throughout our platform.   
- **Lack of allignment with our brand's voice:** users must recognize us regardless of the medium they're interacting with. Our brand's voice and principles must be taken into account in UX Writing.
- **Ambiguous microcopy:** we must be precise with UX text, so our users know how, when, why and what actions they need to take. 
- **Frustrating our users:**: ux copy is what the user ultimately interacts with in a software. We must transmit trust, not trigger confusion.   
 

### Achieve
- **Text alligned with VTEX's goals and brand:** UX writing is how our voice can be heard daily by our clients. We must have a strategic approach with microcopy, transmiting our goals, values and brand principles as a company.
- **Clear information architecture:** it is the structure for an excellent user experience. Not just within modules, but throughout the whole product. 
- **Agility for our user's actions:** the effectiveness of UX Writing can be measure by how long it takes for users to achieve their goals on a screen. Our microcopy should promote agility and confidence to users. 
- **Polished product:** leveraging engineering, design and UX writing so our users recognize our product's reliability and our authority in the market.
