## I want to request UI texts

If you’re developing or updating a screen, you’ll probably need to write some fresh text for the UI. If you’d like to request someone from the Education or Design teams to write or review your copy, follow the instructions below:

### UX Writing Request Checklist:

1. Describe the behavior thoroughly.   
> Some questions you can answer:  
    - What is this button’s expected behavior?      
    - What does this word mean, in our VTEX context?      
    - What is the action the user is trying to accomplish?    

2. Share Figma files, or screenshots of where the microcopy will be located on screen.  
> UX writers must understand the dimensions of the avaialable space, and the text's context within the whole page.  

## I want to request translations for UI text

We have a responsibility of delivering contextualized content to our clients in over 28 countries. Our platform will be soon available in six languages. As a global company, we must guarantee high quality content that is correctly adapted to a region’s audience. 

We advise that UX Writers only publish microcopy in their native language. **Every other translation must go through the Localization team.**

For VTEX emlpoyees, all translation requests must be sent through the localization team’s Google forms. You can find the link, and directions pinned on the #localization channel on Slack. 
When determining a screen’s deploy date, be mindful of the time it takes for content to be translated. We suggest that you send translation requests within 2 weeks before your deadline. Checkout our [Localization](/docs/best-practices/i18n) page for more guidance.   



### Localization request  checklist
Use this checklist to help you build a thorough localization request:

1. Provide already edited microcopy, in your native language.
2. Give the localization team access to Figma files, or screenshots of where the microcopy will be located on screen.
3. Provide lots of context around the microcopy. Some questions you can answer:
    - What is this button’s expected behavior?
    - What does this term mean in our VTEX context?
    - What is the action the user is trying to accomplish?



## I want to create UI Text


UX Writing processes are rarely linear, especially when realized collaboratively. Below you can see the general phases present in our process. Be mindful that their order is flexible, and steps can often be repeated throughout the process. Keep in mind to use the [Voice Chart](/docs/principles/voice-chart) to guide you in all steps of your process.   

### Research
> Understand the component's behavior.  

### Benchmark
> Check internal and external references.   
  
### Draft
> Brainstorm multiple text options.  

### Edit
> Balance voice, conciseness and clarity.  

### Test
> Check how the text appears in the UI, and how users respond.    

### Review
> Peers evaluate the text, helping decide between options.  

### Localize
> Translate the chosen sentence.
