## Overview

### Who is this styleguide for?

UX writing is a collaborative craft in its essence.

In VTEX, we have different teams who collaborate to create the words on our experience. People from _Localization, Design, Product and Education_ teams usually take part in the UX Writing process.

We build for community. **If you are writing the text that appears on our VTEX platform's UI, this styleguide is for you**. It is the resource that everyone involved in UX Writing can count on, to create precise copy, aligned with our tone and voice, following best practices.

We might have different tools to accomplish our goals, but at the end of the day, we want the same thing: to facilitate an intuitive experience for VTEX customers. A shared responsibility means we tackle the challenge together, co-create the resources needed, and scale the access so we have agile processes.

This guide was developed seeking to educate our community about UX Writing in VTEX's context, with no commercial intention.

### What is UX Writing

> "An experience with broken words is a house with broken walls. Fix the words as you would repair the walls." - **Torrey Podmajersky, Strategic Writing for UX**, published by O'Reilly Media, Inc. in June 2019

UX Writing is the craft of designing the words that users see and interact with, in softwares. It is a vital component within the general user experience we want to promote to our clients. Text written in screens is often referred to as microcopy, for we have very limited space to convey actions and concepts.

Where can you find UX Writing, in our VTEX context:

- Our VTEX Commerce Admin
- VTEX IO apps and Toolbelt
- Our stand alone products, like VTEX Tracking
- Our platform status page
- APIs

### What UX Writing is not

UX Writing is not the same as creating content for websites, social media, or documentation. Likewise, this styleguide is not a general guide for copywriting. It is specifically for microcopy that is seen on our VTEX platform's UI, or APIs that developers interact with.

## Goals and Principles

Our brand's voice is present when bringing awareness to our solutions, attracting customers and building a community. We must align all our communication strategies, so our brand's voice is recognizable regardless of the medium our user is interacting with. Once a person becomes our client, and starts using our solutions, they should still recognize our voice. In this page we bring forth our Brand Principles, Tone and Voice and Writing guidelines to remind UX writers how UX copy should always be aligned with our product and brand's strategy.

### Tone and Voice

Although we should transmit the same voice whenever VTEX is speaking, we understand that there are differences between writing a blog post and writing an error message.

On our platforms we deal with sensitive data, and our client's results. It demmands responsibility and respect in how we communicate. Therefore, for UX Writing, we choose to favor the **Serious** and **Authority** tones, from our Brand Manual. We understand that they capture the reliability and expertise our system's voice should have.

#### üì£ Serious

We speak firmly, respectfully and honestly ‚Äî always with a tone that‚Äôs more serious than playful.

**Serious, not playful:** To build trust, we must avoid jokes, puns, and everything that may sound ambiguous. Being straightforward and honest is the key.

#### üì£ Authority

We are the ecommerce bastions. When speaking to others, we talk with mastery, proficiency and expertise.

**Authority, not arbitrary:** We're commerce and technology specialists. Our content embodies that expertise to be useful for our users, never pretentious or obnoxious. Sounding trustful is the key.

#### üì£ Young

We have the energy and the attitude to accelerate the transformations that will take our clients (and ourselves) to the next level. We are restless and passionate.

**Young, not naive:** We must show our passion for tech and commerce and the energy we put on everything we do. Keep the content fresh and pleasant.

#### üì£ Rebel

We are not afraid of making mistakes, because we learn from them and become better as a company. But we are not reckless: We are just bold enough to develop the innovations that will disrupt the market.

**Rebel, not inconsequent:** It's part of our nature to question absolute truths. We constantly challenge ourselves, and our content must do the same. Being bold is the key to that.

### Writing Principles

#### üìù Clarity

No matter the media, the objective, or the audience. Make sure your content is free from any possible ambiguities. Being straightforward on complex (or delicate) themes will help users better understand the message.

#### üìù Suitability

Are you writing for engineers or ecommerce analysts? Are you channeling your message through an online banner or a downloadable white paper? Forget about right or wrong. Consider the target audience, the channel, and focus on what's appropriate.

#### üìù Precision

Stick to the main message you want to communicate and cut everything else. Mixing up many different topics will only confuse the audience and lower the performance of your content.
